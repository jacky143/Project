	<dt id="Q4"><b>What type of filming has taken place (movies, commercials, Tv series) at the farm?</b></dt>
	<dd>We mostly do local commercials, but we once had a big city film crew in here for that one sci-fi show. I think it was called Minority Transcript.</dd>

	<dd>All of the seeds we use are certified non-GMO.</dd>

	<dt id="Q7"><b>How do you price your produce for the market?</b></dt>
	<dd>We base our prices off harvest  yield, our own costs, competitor pricing, demand, etc. We always strive to be fair and competitive.</dd>
	<dt id="Q8"><b>What stores and markets are your crops sold at?</b></dt>
	<dd>We're sold in most major grocers - Wegman's, Wal-Mart, Kroger, Publix, Giant, and others.</dd>
	<dt id="Q9"><b>Would you be interested in having other events, besides weddings; such as farmers markets?</b></dt>
	<dd>As our farm has grown year after year, we've become more open to the idea of trying out different things. Especially if it sparks an interest in farming to those who may not have considered it otherwise.</dd>
	<dt id="Q10"><b>What year was the farm established and how long have been farming for?</b></dt>
	<dd>Virginia Farm was started in 1960 and has been handed down generation after generation every since then. So 60 years and still going strong!</dd>
